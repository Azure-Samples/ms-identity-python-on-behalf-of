## Overview

This sample demonstrates a Python Django Web App calling a Python Flask Web API that is secured using Azure AD.

## Scenario

1. The client Python Django Web App uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to sign-in and obtain a JWT access token from **Azure AD**.
2. The access token is used as a bearer token to authorize the user to call the Python Flask Web API protected **Azure AD**.

## Prerequisites


- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- A virtual environment for each application to to work from
- If using VS Code, select the [Python interpreter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) from the virtual environment
- An Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. For more information on how to get an Azure AD tenant, see [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your own Azure AD tenant. This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**. If have not yet [created a user account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory) in your AD tenant yet, you should do so before proceeding.
> - Configure [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) for debugging Python applications

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-python-on-behalf-of.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Step 2: Install project dependencies
1. Navigate to the project folders
2. Activate your Python 3 virtual environment (either directly in the command line or VS Code)
3. You will need to install dependencies using pip

    * The below shell commands must be executed in both applications as they both have seperate requirements.txt files  
    * There is also Pipfile included in both applications if you prefer to use pipenv instead


For the Flask API application, use the following command: 
```Shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For the Django UI application, local execution only, use the following command: 
```Shell
$ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```
### Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There are two projects in this sample. Each needs to be separately registered in your Azure AD tenant. To register these projects, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Azure AD Powershell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. If you have never used Azure AD Powershell before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

### Register the service app (Python Flask Web API)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `Python Flask Web API`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where we can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**:
   - Type a key description (for instance `app secret`),
   - Select one of the available key durations (**In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**) as per your security posture.
   - The generated key value will be displayed when you select the **Add** button. Copy the generated value for use in the steps later.
   - You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the list of APIs, select the API `Windows Azure Service Management API`.
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **user_impersonation** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an API for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.
The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this Api. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
   - Select `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
   - For this sample, modify the proposed Application ID URI to (`api://flaskapi`) and select **Save**.
1. All APIs have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, follow the following steps:
   - Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
        - For **Scope name**, use `Subscriptions.Read`.
        - Select **Admins and users** options for **Who can consent?**.
        - For **Admin consent display name** type `Access Python Flask Web API`.
        - For **Admin consent description** type `Allows the app to access Python Flask Web API as the signed-in user.`
        - For **User consent display name** type `Access Python Flask Web API`.
        - For **User consent description** type `Allow the application to access Python Flask Web API on your behalf.`
        - Keep **State** as **Enabled**.
        - Select the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.

#### Configure the service app (Python Flask Web API) to use your app registration

1. Find the key `API_SCOPE` and replace the existing value with api://flaskapi/Subscriptions.Read.

#### Configure Known Client Applications for service (Python Flask Web API)

For a middle tier Web API (`Python Flask Web API`) to be able to call a downstream Web API, the middle tier app needs to be granted the required permissions as well.
However, since the middle tier cannot interact with the signed-in user, it needs to be explicitly bound to the client app in its **Azure AD** registration.
This binding merges the permissions required by both the client and the middle tier Web Api and presents it to the end user in a single consent dialog. The user then consent to this combined set of permissions.

To achieve this, you need to add the **Application Id** of the client app, in the Manifest of the Web API in the `knownClientApplications` property. Here's how:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your `Python Flask Web API` app registration, and select **Manifest** section.
1. In the manifest editor, change the `"knownClientApplications": []` line so that the array contains 
   the Client ID of the client application (`Python Django Web App`) as an element of the array.

    For instance:

    ```json
    "knownClientApplications": ["ca8dca8d-f828-4f08-82f5-325e1a1c6428"],
    ```

1. **Save** the changes to the manifest.

## About the code

This sample uses the [Microsoft Authentication Library \(MSAL\) for Python](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python) to sign in a user and obtain a token for the Flask Web API, which will in turn call the Azure Management API on the user's behalf. The Django Web App first checks to see if the user has signed in before by attempting to find the user in the in-memory token cache. If the user is found, the MSAL acquire_token_silent function is first called to pull the user's access token from the token cache and then the Flask API is called. If the user is not found in the token cache, they will be redirect to account/login to sign in. Once called, the Flask API will validate the access token, using the validation logic from [authorization.py](..\FlaskAPI\helpers\authorization.py), and will in turn create a new access token using the MSAL acquire_token_on_behalf_of function. This token will then be used to call the Azure Management API, subscriptions endpoint, on-behalf-of the user who initiated the request from the Django Web App.
